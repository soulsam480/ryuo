### Stack

- Electron 11.x
- Vue 3.x
- Vite 2.x

The base repo is a fork of [@ci010/electron-vue-next](https://github.com/ci010/electron-vue-next). Almost perfect Electron, Vue 3 and Vite integration.

### Why

There are multiple complete and amazing projects which do exactly the same and better, but I wanted to measure my skills as a developer by creating a project like this. Just a hobby project to learn something new.
